            <p>According to Ayurveda, the human body is governed by three principal energies, also known as doshas.
                These doshas are Pitta, Vata and Kapha.
                Every individual has all three fundamental doshas; however, one dosha is more prominent than the rest.
                This prominent dosha determines the Ayurvedic body type or constitution, also known as Prakriti.
                Ancient wisdom defines the human body as a conglomeration of water, air, earth, fire, and ether. These 5
                elements make up the human body and handle its functioning. However, all the elements must exist
                proportionally to ensure balance and stability. If this balance is disturbed beyond a certain point, the
                body may experience discomfort or collapse altogether. Each Prakriti has different characteristic features. The concept of Prakriti makes Ayurveda unique from other medical systems. Selection of treatment, medicine is different for each individual depending upon their Prakriti.
